A tool for finding error fractions of multiplier approximations available [here](http://gla23.github.io/factor-grid).

To do: A tool for helping with a method I made up that lets you do mental arithmetic visually using a grid of factors. This method might be easier and faster, or it might just make things harder. Either way its pretty fun.

| `axes=11,6,5`       | Provide a default to the axis lengths                                                              |
| `hidden=2,2+-1,3`   | Display "???" over the numbers at the given co-ordinates. This is for practising using the system. |
